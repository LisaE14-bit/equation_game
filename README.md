## **Example Gameplay**

Hereâ€™s what it looks like:

```plaintext
Welcome to the Equation Game!

Question 1: 4 Ã— x = 20
Your answer for x: 5
That's Right!

Question 2: 7 Ã— x = 42
Your answer for x: 6
That's Right!

Question 3: 8 Ã— x = 56
Your answer for x: 7
That's Right!

GAME OVER! Your total score is 3/3.
```

## **Tips for Beginners**

- Donâ€™t worry if you get an answer wrongâ€”the correct answer is displayed for you.
- Make sure to enter only numbers; invalid inputs like letters or symbols will prompt you to try again.

## **Customisation Ideas**

I did some research on how I can make the game even more exciting: Try these ideas:
- **Change the number range**: Adjust the `random.randint` values to create harder or easier equations.
- **Add more questions**: Modify the `total_questions` variable to increase the challenge.

## **Technical Manual: Equation Game**

### **1. Purpose of the Code**
This Python code implements a simple interactive game where players solve randomly generated multiplication equations in the form of \(a Ã— x = b\). The player provides their answer for \(x\), and the programme evaluates whether the answer is correct. The game tracks the playerâ€™s score over multiple questions and displays the total score at the end.

---

### **2. Code Breakdown**

#### **2.1 Importing Libraries**
```python
import random
```
- **Purpose**: The `random` module is used to generate random numbers for the equations.  
- **Why Random Numbers?**: It ensures that each game session is unique and challenging.

---

#### **2.2 Function: `generate_equation()`**
```python
def generate_equation():
    """
    Generates a random equation of the form: a Ã— x = b.
    Returns the equation as a string and the correct value of x.
    """
    a = random.randint(1, 10)  # Random integer for coefficient (a)
    x = random.randint(1, 10)  # Random integer for the variable (x)
    b = a * x  # Calculate the result (b)
    equation = f"{a} Ã— x = {b}"  # Format the equation as a string
    return equation, x  # Return the equation and the correct answer (x)
```

- **Purpose**: Creates a multiplication equation using two random integers, `a` and `x`. The result `b` is computed as \(a Ã— x\).  
- **Output**: A tuple containing:
  - The equation as a formatted string (e.g., `"3 Ã— x = 12"`).  
  - The correct value of \(x\).

---

#### **2.3 Function: `check_answer(user_answer, correct_answer)`**
```python
def check_answer(user_answer, correct_answer):
    """
    Validates the user's answer and returns True if correct, False otherwise.
    """
    return user_answer == correct_answer
```
- **Purpose**: Compares the userâ€™s input (`user_answer`) with the correct solution (`correct_answer`).  
- **Output**: Returns `True` if the answers match, otherwise `False`.

---

#### **2.4 Function: `display_score(score, total_questions)`**
```python
def display_score(score, total_questions):
    """
    Displays the user's total score at the end of the game.
    """
    print(f"GAME OVER! Your total score is {score}/{total_questions}.")
```
- **Purpose**: Outputs the player's final score, showing the number of correct answers out of the total questions.

---

#### **2.5 Function: `main()`**
```python
def main():
    """
    Main function to run the game.
    """
    print("Welcome to the Equation Game!")
    total_questions = 3  # Total number of questions in the game
    score = 0  # Initial score

    for i in range(total_questions):  # Loop through the questions
        equation, correct_answer = generate_equation()  # Generate a random equation
        print(f"Question {i + 1}: {equation}")  # Display the equation

        try:
            user_answer = int(input("Your answer for x: "))  # Get user input
            if check_answer(user_answer, correct_answer):  # Validate the answer
                print("That's Right!")  # Correct feedback
                score += 1  # Increment the score
            else:
                print(f"This is incorrect! The correct answer was {correct_answer}.")  # Incorrect feedback
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")  # Handle non-numeric input

    display_score(score, total_questions)  # Display the final score
```
- **Purpose**: This function orchestrates the entire game:
  - Welcomes the player.  
  - Loops through `total_questions` to ask questions and evaluate answers.  
  - Handles user input and errors gracefully.  
  - Displays the final score at the end.

### **3. Why Doesnâ€™t This Code Return Decimal Points?**
The code exclusively works with **integers** because:  
1. **Random Integer Generation**:  
   - The `random.randint(1, 10)` function generates whole numbers only.  
   - This ensures that both \(a\) and \(x\) are integers.  

2. **Multiplication**:  
   - The calculation \(b = a Ã— x\) produces an integer result as both \(a\) and \(x\) are integers.  

3. **Answer Checking**:  
   - The user is asked for an integer answer (`int(input(...))`).  
   - This means the programme cannot accept decimal inputs, ensuring answers remain whole numbers.  

---

### **5. Summary**
- **Code Purpose**: A fun game for solving multiplication problems.  
- **Key Features**: Random equation generation, user feedback, and score tracking.  
- **Strengths**: Clean structure, modular design, and beginner-friendly functionality.  
- **Limitations**: Only supports integer values.
